# hf_simple_map
This is a leaflet map, the user can switch on two point layers, Homes and Unis, that are represented by Majatalo and UTU logos, respectively.
There is an option to choose between two basemaps, Jawg Dark and Esri Satellite imagery. The minzoom is set to 1 and the maxzoom to 13 for privacy reasons.
In the top left corner there are three buttons, the first one is for zooming in, the second one for zooming out and the third one for measuring distances and areas.
The attribution is located in the bottom right corner. 
I am open to any suggestions.
